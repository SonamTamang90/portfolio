                Iâ€™ve loved making things for as long as I can remember, and
                wrote my first program when I was 6 years old, just two weeks
                after my mom brought home the brand new Macintosh LC 550 that I
                taught myself to type on.

                I spent the next few summers indoors working on a rocket design,
                while I recovered from the multiple surgeries it took to fix my
                badly broken legs.
              </p>

                Thank you for taking the time to learn more about me. I look
                forward to the possibility of connecting and exploring how we
                can create value together.
